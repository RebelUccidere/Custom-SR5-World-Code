This is intended for use by anyone looking to create a custom setting using both the bones of Chummer and Shadowrun 5th edition by CGL. Anyone is allowed to use and modify the code as they see fit or simply use if deemed neccessary.

To install this into your Chummer, simply place the Chummer file into: Chummer\customdata.

When selecting custom data, check the "Custom World Bans" to mark it as active within your chummer when making a setting file.
